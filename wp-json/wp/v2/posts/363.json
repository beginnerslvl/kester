A great commerce experience is a trilemma that carefully balances competing needs of delivering great customer experience, dynamic storefront capabilities, and long-term business \u2014 conversion, retention, re-engagement \u2014 objectives. As developers, we rightfully obsess about the customer experience, relentlessly working to squeeze every millisecond out of the critical rendering path, optimize input latency, and eliminate jank.
